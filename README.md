Experiment 6 - Study of Conditional Statements in Python
This repository contains the Python implementations for Experiment 6, conducted as part of the Electronics and Telecommunication (ENTC) engineering curriculum. The primary objective of this experiment is to understand and apply conditional logic using if, elif, and else statements to solve various computational problems.

Experiment Overview
Student Name: Shreyas Wani

PRN: 2507012131

Topic: Study of Conditional Statements in Python

Sub-Experiments Description
6a. Number Classification

Checks whether a user-provided integer is positive, negative, or zero.

6b. Even or Odd

Determines if a number is divisible by 2. It utilizes the modulo operator % to check for a remainder.

6c. Largest of Three Numbers

Compares three user-input integers to find the greatest value.

Note: This implementation highlights the importance of using the logical and operator for multiple conditions rather than the bitwise & operator.

6d. Single Subject Grading

Calculates a letter grade based on a single score:

A Grade: ≥90

B Grade: ≥75

C Grade: ≥60

D Grade: ≥40

F Grade: <40

6e. Multi-Subject Average & Grading

Takes inputs for three subjects (Maths, Python, and DCLD), calculates the average, and assigns a grade based on the same scale as 6d.

6f. Leap Year Checker

Determines if a given year is a leap year based on the standard Gregorian calendar rules:

Divisible by 400 OR

Divisible by 4 but NOT by 100.

6g. Date Incrementer

A program that accepts a date (DD, MM, YYYY), accounts for leap years and varying month lengths (28, 29, 30, or 31 days), and automatically calculates the date for the following day.

6h. Vowel or Consonant

Checks if a single character input is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or a consonant using the in membership operator.

6i. Gross Salary Calculation

Calculates total salary based on a basic pay input and tiered allowances:

Basic ≤10,000: HRA 20%, DA 80%

Basic ≤20,000: HRA 25%, DA 90%

Above 20,000: HRA 30%, DA 95%

6j. Income Tax Calculation

Calculates tax based on annual income brackets:

Up to 2,50,000: 0%

2,50,001 - 5,00,000: 5%

5,00,001 - 10,00,000: 20%

Above 10,00,000: 30%
